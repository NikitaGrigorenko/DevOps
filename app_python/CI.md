# CI best Practicies

- Use of Latest Actions: The workflow uses the latest versions of GitHub Actions. This ensures that the workflow benefits from the latest features and security updates.

- Dependency Caching: The workflow caches dependencies using actions/cache@v2, which speeds up the installation of Python packages.

- Secrets Management: Secrets like SNYK_TOKEN, DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, and DOCKERHUB_PASS are stored securely using GitHub Secrets.

- Working Directory: The working-directory key is used to specify the directory in which subsequent steps should be executed.

- Conditional Pushing: The Docker image is only pushed if the workflow is triggered by a tag.

- Security Checks: The workflow includes a security check using Snyk.

- Linting: The workflow includes a linting step using flake8, which helps to maintain code quality.

- Docker Buildx: The workflow uses Docker Buildx for building Docker images.

- Event Trigger: The workflow is triggered on every push event.
