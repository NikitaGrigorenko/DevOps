We can see that there were more visits to the first pod than the second after visiting in browser. 
The reason for this discrepancy in my opinion is most likely that the second pod 
only received healthcheck queries from `minikube service`. While the first pod 
received most proxied requests. Also, I think, that if load balancer were presented here maybe 
there was greater equality in the numbers.

Since each pod operates independently of the others my app does not require ordering guarantees. If we want we can launch a lot of pods in parallel.
